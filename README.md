## :tada: Hi! I am Leonardo and welcome to my profile
I'm a front-end developer trying to avoid bugs haha!

I've been studying front-end since 2024 on Alura.

What made me start studying programming was the fact that I always wanted to know what was going on behind the beautiful part of the screen, and what made me study front-end was the ability that the front-end has to transform a simple code in art for the eyes.
